# Audio File Support Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extend our document chat feature to support audio files. Users will be able to upload audio recordings (lectures, meetings, etc.), have them transcribed, and then chat with the content just like they can with PDFs and text documents.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Audio File Processing Pipeline

#### File Upload Enhancements
- Extend the current upload component to accept audio file formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
- Add file type validation for audio formats
- Implement audio file size limits and validation

#### Audio Transcription Service
- Integrate with OpenAI's Whisper API for high-quality transcription
- Implement fallback options with alternative transcription services
- Add language detection and support for multiple languages

#### Transcription Processing
- Convert audio transcriptions to text documents
- Implement timestamp preservation for reference
- Add speaker diarization (if available) to distinguish between speakers
- Store both the original audio and the transcription

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Upload Interface
- Add audio-specific upload options
- Provide audio recording capability directly in the browser
- Display audio file metadata (duration, size, format)

#### Playback Integration
- Add audio player in the chat interface
- Implement timestamp linking between chat responses and audio segments
- Allow users to play specific sections mentioned in the chat

#### Progress Indicators
- Show transcription progress for longer audio files
- Provide estimated completion time

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Audio Support

1. **Backend API Enhancement**
   - Create a new API endpoint for audio file processing
   - Implement audio file validation
   - Integrate with OpenAI Whisper for transcription

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Update file upload component to accept audio files
   - Add audio file type validation
   - Implement basic audio upload UI

3. **Transcription Flow**
   - Process audio files and generate transcriptions
   - Store transcriptions in the same format as document text
   - Generate embeddings from transcriptions

### Phase 2: Enhanced Audio Experience

1. **Audio Playback Integration**
   - Add audio player component to the chat interface
   - Implement basic playback controls

2. **Timestamp Linking**
   - Preserve timestamps in transcriptions
   - Link chat responses to specific audio segments
   - Allow playback from specific points mentioned in chat

3. **Speaker Diarization**
   - Identify different speakers in the audio
   - Format transcriptions with speaker labels
   - Enhance chat responses with speaker context

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Multi-language Support**
   - Detect audio language automatically
   - Support transcription in multiple languages
   - Enable translation capabilities

2. **Audio Summarization**
   - Generate summaries specific to audio content
   - Identify key moments in recordings
   - Create chapter markers for longer recordings

3. **Search Enhancements**
   - Enable searching within audio transcriptions
   - Implement semantic search across audio content
   - Allow filtering by speakers or timestamps

## Technical Architecture

### Audio Processing Flow

```
User Upload → Validation → Storage → Transcription → Text Processing → Embedding Generation → Chat Availability
```

### API Endpoints

1. **`/api/process-audio-file`**
   - Handles audio file uploads
   - Validates file format and size
   - Initiates transcription process

2. **`/api/audio-transcription-status`**
   - Provides status updates for long-running transcriptions
   - Returns progress percentage and estimated completion time

3. **`/api/audio-chat`**
   - Similar to document-chat but optimized for audio transcriptions
   - Includes timestamp references in responses

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- New table for audio files
CREATE TABLE audio_files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER,
  transcription_status TEXT,
  transcription_url TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table for audio segments with timestamps
CREATE TABLE audio_segments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  audio_id UUID REFERENCES audio_files(id),
  start_time FLOAT,
  end_time FLOAT,
  speaker TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Large Audio Files

**Problem**: Audio files can be very large, especially for lectures or long meetings.
**Solution**: Implement chunked uploads, server-side processing limits, and progress indicators.

### Challenge 2: Transcription Accuracy

**Problem**: Transcription may not be perfect, especially with technical terms or multiple speakers.
**Solution**: Allow users to view and edit transcriptions, implement confidence scores, and use domain-specific models when available.

### Challenge 3: Processing Time

**Problem**: Transcribing long audio files can take significant time.
**Solution**: Implement asynchronous processing with webhooks, provide status updates, and allow users to be notified when processing is complete.

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Clear Expectations**: Communicate processing times and limitations clearly
2. **Fallback Options**: Provide alternatives if transcription fails or is low quality
3. **Incremental Availability**: Make transcribed portions available for chat before the entire file is processed
4. **Feedback Loop**: Allow users to report transcription errors or issues

## Required Dependencies

1. **OpenAI Whisper API** for transcription
2. **FFmpeg** for audio file processing and conversion
3. **Audio waveform visualization** libraries for the frontend
4. **Web Audio API** for browser-based recording and playback

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Basic Support)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Enhanced Experience)**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features)**: 4-6 weeks

## Success Metrics

1. **Transcription Accuracy**: Measured by sampling and manual review
2. **Processing Time**: Average time to make audio available for chat
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on audio chat feature usefulness
4. **Usage Metrics**: Adoption rate and engagement with audio files vs. documents
