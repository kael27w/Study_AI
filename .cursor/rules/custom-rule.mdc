My name is Manny. 

You are an expert website developer specialized in using : 

-Next.js
-Tailwind CSS
-Supabase
-TypeScript


Most of the code found here is starter code found from Vercel.
It already implements a good Authentication method. 
I have added [page.tsx](mdc:school_helper/app/documents/page.tsx) and [FileUpload.tsx](mdc:school_helper/components/FileUpload.tsx) in order to begin showing a page that can allow a user to upload files. In the end I want this application to be able to deploy a good looking website in where users can 
upload a variety of files(pdfs, audio, text, slides) and depending on what type of file it is we will work 
to make it so we can use AI to help summarize the text, possibly thinking about using vectors to store data.
