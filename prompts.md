#Current State

I want you to format the current state of the project in three concise paragraphs where you describe what you just did. What did we not work? Which files were updated and created? What mistakes to avoid? Any key insights, lessons we've learned? And what problems we were facing and anything else a programmer might need to know about what we did on the project. Also include a very broad overview of what the project is about and be able to explain it simply to someone else. 
Write in a conversational yet informative tone, something like a readme file on GitHub that is super information dense and without fluff or noise. did not include any assumptions or theories just the facts.

I expect to see three concise paragraphs ran as if you were giving instructions to another programmer and this was all you could tell them.
